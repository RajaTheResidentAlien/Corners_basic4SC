# Corners_basic4SC
the old 'Corners' app(made for monome grids by tehn long ago in Max/MSP/Javascript), remade here in SuperCollider.
requirements:
see 'Grid Studies': https://monome.org/docs/grid/studies/sc/
for the required 'MonomeSC' library
(the code specifically needs the 'MonomeGrid.sc' class file in your supercollider extensions folder)

-Thanks, Enjoy!
